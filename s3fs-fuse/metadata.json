Bluepill monitoring is optional and the maxmemory allows bluepill\nto kill off and remount any s3 mounts that misbehave.\n\nNote: Bluepill should be considered for any s3fs built bucket that has large number\nof entries within directories. Running an `ls` on these directories will cause the\nmount's memory to balloon. Bluepill will happily watch for this (ballooning memory)\nand remount the bucket.\n",
